Dramatic.SlideShare
===================

Dramatic.SlideShare is a running experiment to talking with the SlideShare API2: http://www.slideshare.net/developers

I attended the SharePoint Connect 2014 Amsterdam in november 2014 and was looking for a conveniant way to download the slides from SlideShare. This PowerShell module 'Dramatic.SlideShare' is an ongoing implementation of the SlideShare API and specifically the API method 'get_slideshows_by_user'. This method returns the Slide Decks for a specific SlideShare user.

Organizer NC Communications (http://www.nccomms.com/) has published the SharePoint Connect 2014 slide decks. 
PowerShell Script 'Dowload_SPCA2014_Slides.ps1' loads the Dramatic.SlideShare module and downloads the slide decks to the specified folder.

IMPORTANT: apply for your own SlideShare API key at http://www.slideshare.net/developers/applyforapi
and register your personal SlideShare key and secret into 'Download_SPCA2014_Slides.ps1'.

Disclaimer: work in progress.
